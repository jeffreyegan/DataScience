Multiple Tables with REBU

Let's practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a data analyst at REBU, a ridesharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

    trips - trips information
    riders - users data
    cars - autonomous cars

Have fun!


SELECT * FROM trips;
SELECT * FROM riders;
SELECT * FROM cars;

/* Primary key for all tables is id */

SELECT * FROM riders CROSS JOIN cars;
/* Result is not particularly useful */

SELECT * FROM trips LEFT JOIN riders ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;

SELECT * FROM trips JOIN cars ON trips.car_id = cars.id;

SELECT * FROM riders UNION SELECT * FROM riders2;

SELECT AVG(cost) FROM trips;

SELECT * FROM riders WHERE total_trips < 500;

SELECT * FROM cars WHERE status = 'active';

SELECT * FROM cars ORDER BY trips_completed DESC LIMIT 2;
