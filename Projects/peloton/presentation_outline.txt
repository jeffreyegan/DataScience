Intro

High Level Stats of Accomplishment
- Total Classes, Hours, Miles, etc
- Challenges Completed

Quantize some Preferences
- Live /OD 
- Time of Day
- Class Length Pref
- Instructor Pref

Did instructor preferences match up with who pushed me hardest?

Speaking of progress... how has my fitness / outputs improved?

Rate of growth has slowed but I haven't fully plateaud yet. I'm on the verge of capturing new PRs without trying, and if the class structure has been more condusive to a PR I probably would have.






Goals for Future
Finish collecting the special event badges that are still available
Discover my Power Zones Program
Take at least one class with every instructor this year - including the German ones
Continue more strength classes
Adapt some tread classes for the bike
